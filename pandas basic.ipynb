    "    \n",

    "A DataFrame in pandas is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different data types. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table and is a primary data structure used for data manipulation and analysis in pandas.\n",

    "A Series is a 1-dimensional data structure that represents a single column of data, while a DataFrame is a 2-dimensional structure that can hold multiple columns.\n",
